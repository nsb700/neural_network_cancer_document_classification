# NEURAL NETWORK CANCER DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION

***

## Description :-

This jupyter notebook solves the problem of classifiying cancer documents correctly into one of 3 categories,
'Thyroid_Cancer', 'Colon_Cancer', 'Lung_Cancer'. The problem and the dataset can be found at - 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/falgunipatel19/biomedical-text-publication-classification.

This notebook shows how one can use Neural Network Embeddings to solve this classification problem. 
Both alternatives - Embeddings with pre-computed embeddings and without, are implemented. 

Pre-computed embeddings used are the GLOVE word embeddings from 2014 English Wikipedia, downloaded from 
https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove.

Coding is done using Python and Keras. Intermediate outputs are printed in the notebook for clarity.
